# Science_Fiction_DataViz_Python
Statistical analysis and graph visualisation of the Science Fiction Books dataset.

I went through this short statistical analysis as part of my Humanities class (Philosophy of Science Fiction, taught by Pr. Jonathan Degen√®ve) at Ecole Polytechnique.
My goal was to practice data manipulation with pandas and numpy, and data visualisation with matplotlib and seaborn, using a science fiction-related dataset.
