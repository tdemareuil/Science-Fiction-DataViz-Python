# What are the most popular themes in Science Fiction literature?

Statistical analysis and graph visualisation of the [Science Fiction Books](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/tools/datasets/internal/index.php) dataset.

I went through this short statistical analysis as part of my Humanities class (_Philosophy of Science Fiction_, taught by Pr. Jonathan Degen√®ve) at Ecole Polytechnique.

My goal was to practice data manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy` and data visualisation with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, using a science fiction-related dataset.

All analyses and graphs can be found in the pdf, html or notebook versions of the document.
